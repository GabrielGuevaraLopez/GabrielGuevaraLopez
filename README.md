# 👋 Hey, I'm Gabriel

I'm an IT student at NHL Stenden with a strong focus on **backend development**, **cybersecurity**, and **system architecture**.  
I’ve worked on real-world projects ranging from enterprise-level school systems to penetration tests for companies.  
Currently, I’m following the **Hack@Sea cybersecurity minor**, aiming to go even deeper into offensive security, OT/ICS security, and threat analysis.
